## Features

- **Wallet Integration**: Ready-to-use connections with Azguard and Obsidion wallets
- **Private Voting Contract**: Complete example of a privacy-preserving voting system
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Shadcn UI components
- **Network Information**: Real-time Aztec Network status display
- **Dark Mode**: Sleek dark theme optimized for developers

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- NPM or Yarn
- Access to Aztec Network (Testnet or Local Sandbox)
- Azguard and/or Obsidion wallet extensions installed in your browser

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/raven-house/aztec-nextjs-starter.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd aztec-starter

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Contract setup

# Commands

Install All dependencies

```bash
aztec-nargo build
```

Compile contracts

```bash
aztec-nargo compile
```

Generate contract artifacts

```bash
aztec codegen -o ../src/artifacts target --force
```

Run test cases(Trixie)

```bash
aztec test
```


**NOTE:** You need to register your contract first using script `bun run register-contract` before trying deployment using Obsidion wallet.


## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_NODE_URL=https://aztec-alpha-testnet-fullnode.zkv.xyz
APP_MODE=SANDBOX # or TESTNET for testnet deployment

## Using the Starter

### Wallet Connection

1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the header
2. Select either Azguard or Obsidion wallet
3. Approve the connection request in your wallet

The application stores the connected wallet information in the global context, making it available throughout the application.

### Private Voting Contract Example

The starter includes a complete example of a private voting contract with the following functionalities:

1. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the EasyPrivateVoting contract to Aztec Network
2. **Register Contract Class**: Register the contract class before deployment if necessary
3. **Cast Vote**: Cast a private vote (encrypted on-chain)
4. **Check Votes**: View the current vote count without revealing individual votes
5. **End Voting**: Finalize the voting process

### Contract Details

The `EasyPrivateVoting` contract demonstrates privacy-preserving voting where:

- Votes are encrypted and private
- Only vote tallies are visible, not individual votes
- Only the admin can end the voting process
- Results are verifiably correct without compromising privacy
